## Objective
To build a responsive website using HTML and CSS that will showcase your professional portfolio, which will include the projects you’ll build throughout your Full-Stack Web Development Program, to your professional network and potential employers.

## Context
For a professional web developer, it’s essential to have a designated place to present your work and demonstrate relevant skills such as problem-solving or practical knowledge in a programming language. Since chances are high that you’ll be evaluated, first and foremost, on the quality of the website itself (not just by the projects you’re presenting), it’s essential for it to be of high code quality. Additionally, as responsive design has become a basic requirement for nearly all web-based projects, it’s important that your website be responsive and run smoothly on all devices.

The goal of this project is to create a working website, complete with subpages, that features key information about you as a web developer, relevant work examples, as well as your contact details. You’ll also have the option of including the projects you’ll be building throughout your Full-Stack Web Development Program (all or only a selection), so keep that in mind as you begin planning the HTML structure of your website.

## The 5 W's

### Who
Your professional network, as well as potential employers. The website will be for anyone interested in your professional work and who might want to contact you about it.

### What
A responsive portfolio website built with HTML and CSS.

### When
The website might be visited when a potential employer is checking out your previous experience or after you’ve met a professional contact and they want to see what you’re up to.

### Where
Potential employers might look at the website from their offices, while networking contacts might access it from their mobile phones (e.g., after meeting you).

### Why
For your potential employers, clients, or collaborators to learn more about your professional experience and relevant skills, as well as how to reach you. The site will also demonstrate your front-end development skills to employers.

## Features & Requirements

### User Goals
Your users should be able to view your professional portfolio website and navigate between web pages on both mobile and desktop.

### Key Features
- A homepage with a short introduction and link(s) to work examples
- An about page with key information about you as an individual, your relevant skills, and the tools or programming language(s) you use
- A section with your work examples—either as part of your homepage (e.g., in a grid) or on a separate work page
